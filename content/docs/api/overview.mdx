## Available Tools

Glide exposes the following tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We are mindful of the number of tools we expose to your coding IDE's LLMs. 

### `split_commit`

Splits a large unified diff / commit into smaller semantically-grouped commits.

**Parameters:**

- `workspace_root` (string, optional): Path to the workspace root directory. If not provided, attempts to detect it from environment variables or the current directory.

**Usage:**

This tool analyzes your staged and unstaged changes, generates embeddings for the diffs, and uses AI to propose and create semantic commits.

### `resolve_conflict`

Detects merge conflicts in the repository, resolves them using AI, and applies the changes with MorphLLM.

**Parameters:**

- `workspace_root` (string, optional): Path to the workspace root directory.

**Behavior:**

1. Detects files with merge conflicts.
2. Uses a local LLM (via Ollama) to resolve the conflict [This will change with our hosted inference service in the near future].
3. Uses MorphLLM to apply the resolution to the file.
4. Writes the changes immediately.
5. Returns a preview of the resolution.

### `revert_conflict_resolution`

Reverts the resolved conflict files back to their original state with conflicts. Use this if you want to undo the changes applied by `resolve_conflict`.

**Parameters:**

- `file_path` (string, optional): Path to a specific file to revert.
- `workspace_root` (string, optional): Path to the workspace root directory.
- `revert_all` (boolean, default: `false`): If `true`, reverts all pending resolutions.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled via the environment variables configured in your MCP client. See [Configuration](/docs/guides/configuration) for details.
